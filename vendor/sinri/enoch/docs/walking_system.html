        <h2>Enoch and Walker</h2>
        <div class="inner_container">
            The two classes, Enoch and Walker, support the regular tasks to run under command line mode.
            Enoch defines the configuration and necessary helpers, and provides a method called start to call.
            According to the configuration, Enoch would decide what Walkers should be used and their order.
            As decided, Enoch creates Walker Instances and run walk method of each.

        <div class="inner_container">
            To use the walking system, you need to create a directory for a project, and the name of it.
            In this directory, set one class implementing Enoch, and also one class or more implementing Walker.
            You then need to set up the configuration. By default, it uses file config.php to store.
            You can override the method readConfig for your own to define config property.
            You can set the work process in the method walk, which is the main function of a Walker instance.
        </div>
        <div class="inner_container">
            In Walker class defined properties db, sftp, mailer, etc.
            You can override installX methods for your needs, to fulfill the related property.
            Initially, Spirit would be set as logger, and config would be referred from Enoch.
