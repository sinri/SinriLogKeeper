Edit the `slk.config` file, set the security settings and log file paths\r\n3. Make this project visitable, and visit the `index.php`.\r\n\r\n### Advance\r\n\r\n* About awk\r\n\r\nSinriLogKeeper use `awk` to filter the log lines. Sometimes when the log line has too many spaces, you might meet a `bug` that the search engine of GREP reponses empty, but PHP method would not. Actually, the reason might be that awk threw an error like\r\n\r\n> awk: program limit exceeded: maximum number of fields size=32767\r\n\r\nwhere you cannot see it.\r\n\r\n[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24292787/awk-program-limit-exceeded-maximum-number-of-fields-size-32767) tells us. \r\n\r\n> On ubuntu awk is a soft link to some variant of awk, nowadays by default it is mawk. Try to install gawk. gawk does not have a limitation on the number of fields in a record.\r\n\r\nSo if you found you are using mawk, install gawk instead.\r\n\r\n\t# check which awk you use\r\n\tls -alh `ls -alh \\`which awk\\` | awk '{print $11}'`\r\n\t# if you were using mawk\r\n\tapp-get install gawk\r\n\r\n## Features Footprints\r\n\r\n### Up to Ver 1.1\r\n\r\n* Shell wildcard pattern for log file path supported\r\n* Line range support\r\n* Three search methods including Regular Expression support\r\n* Result Limitation to protect the server\r\n* Optional security settings as user auth support\r\n\r\n### Since Ver 1.2\r\n\r\n* Add Grep Support (Only UNIX-Like(Linux) Supported), which seems to be stronger to deal with huge size files\r\n\r\n### Since Ver 1.3\r\n\r\n* Add view-around-lines function\r\n* Download log file (Experimental)\r\n\r\n## Reason\r\n\r\nI was trapped with Filebeat and Logstash, as filebeat always lost connection to logstash server on Debian.\r\n\r\nWhy not visit the log files directly on server.\r\n\r\n## Users\r\n\r\nNow SinriLogKeeper is powering Develop Team of [Leqee Group](http://www.leqee.com/).",
