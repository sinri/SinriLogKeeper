Edit the `slk.config` file, set the log file paths. Shell wildcard pattern supported.\r\n3. Make this project visitable, and visit the `index.php`.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Line Range Support\r\n* Three search methods including Regular Expression support\r\n* Result Limitation to protect the server\r\n\r\n## Reason\r\n\r\nI was trapped with Filebeat and Logstash, as filebeat always lost connection to logstash server on Debian.\r\n\r\nWhy not visit the log files directly on server.",
